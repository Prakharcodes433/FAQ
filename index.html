    <div class="answer">
      <p>The Internet is a global network of physical cables, including copper telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. When you visit a website, your device sends a request through these cables to a server, which stores the website's data and sends it back to you.</p>

      <h4>Why is the sky blue during the day?</h4>

          </span>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>This happens because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.</p>

    <div class="answer">
      <p>A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and untrusted networks, such as the Internet, to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

      <h4>How do plants produce oxygen?</h4>
          <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
          arrow_drop_down
          </span>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Plants produce oxygen through a process called photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide and water, use sunlight as energy to turn them into glucose for food, and release oxygen into the atmosphere as a byproduct.</p>

      <h4>What causes the seasons to change?</h4>
          <span class="material-symbols-outlined">
          arrow_drop_down
          </span>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Seasons change because the Earth is tilted on its axis as it orbits the Sun. Throughout the year, different parts of Earth receive the Sun's most direct rays. When the North Pole tilts toward the Sun, it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

          </span>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet. Instead of buying and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, from providers like AWS or Google Cloud.</p>
